# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anne :tiger: :zap:


## Who I am 

I am a junior web developer from Belgium and I am passionate about **Blockchain** and **Web3**.

If I would have to describe my character, I would say that I am a little bit a mix of an **introvert/extravert**. I like to be surrounded with people but I also appreciate to be alone. I find it very important to make time for myself each day. To practice sport (like to do **yoga** or to do **jogging**) enables that I can be with my own and take care of myself. I also enjoy to walk alone and listening to interesting **podcasts** at the same time. 
I can be funny and social but I need to feel comfortable with people first  :smile:


Besides to do sport, in my free time I really like to read **books** and to go to event related to **art** (music events, exhibitions, etc.). I really like all sort of art but I have a slight preference for **modern art**. To sum it up, my interests are a mix of sciences, new technologies and art. I am always up for a good conversation about those topics.


I consider myself as a non stop learner in my career of my free time. I am also passionated about languages, I speak fluently 3 languages(Fr-EN-DT) and I have German notions (still currently learning this language). Later, I also would like to learn **Russian**.

## My three most surprising skills
1. I speak three languages *French - Dutch - English* fluently 
2. I have two nationalities *Belgian - Luxembourgish*
3. I have an amazing sense of direction

1. Berlin
2. New Technologies
